                  I had never understood why I was so bothered by poorly designed
                  mobile apps, websites, software, or game interfaces while other
                  people couldn&apos;t share my suffering and most of the time even
                  struggled to acknowledge its roots. Until I realized: I could be
                  the person who creates something better, who actually cares
                  about people on the other side of a product. Since then, my
                  emotional response to mediocre design hasn&apos;t changed much, but
                  now I can channel that into my profession instead of it being a
                  mere quirky fixation with interfaces.

                  Unique combination of traditional architectural education with
                  modern research-based psychology allows me to deeply understand
                  user thought processes and needs, thereby crafting experiences
                  that are both intuitive and visually compelling.

                  I thrive on complex products. Whether it&apos;s diverse user needs
                  and stories, complex business logic, or dense data structures,
                  I love transforming them into clear, functional, and
                  user-friendly designs.

                  Outside of design, I find joy in composing music and playing
                  guitar, creating with my hands through woodworking, and
                  exploring nature with my wife and our twisted-tail dog, Beemo.
